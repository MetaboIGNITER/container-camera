## Installation

CAMERA is present on all PhenoMeNal Galaxy instances on deployed Cloud Research Environments, under the MS category in the tool bar to the left of the screen. No installation is needed hence on PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environments.

For advanced Docker usage:

- Go to the directory where the dockerfile is.
- Create container from dockerfile:

```
docker build -t camera .
```

Alternatively, pull from repo:

```
docker pull container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/camera
```

## Usage Instructions

On a PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environment, go to MS tool category, and then click on CAMERA, and fill the expected input files, then press Run. 

Alternatively, to use locally through the docker image:

```
docker run --entrypoint=<script-name> container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/camera <arguments for script>
```

Where script can be any of: 

```
cameraToFeatureXML.r
featureXMLToCAMERA.r
findAdducts.r
groupCorr.r
xsAnnotate.r
consensusXMLToXcms.r
featureXMLToXcms.r
findIsotopes.r
groupFWHM.r
```
